# ADCS-Simulation
Updates 24 Nov 2020:
1 - Orbit propagator works correctly (had some km/m unit issues, now just input state vector lengths in km) 
2 - Magnetic Field functions checked and cleaned up, reference added
3 - Power function includes sun to calculate dark side or not
4 - Preliminary bang bang active control shows angular velocity decreasing over time
